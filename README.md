PolynomialCalc
==============

It's small hobbyist's project which I decided to make after maths lessons about polynomials. It's still work in progress and for awhile I suspend it, but if anybody finds it interesting, can work on this code a little :)

Requirements
------------

I prefer Netbeans, so I included all project files for this.
Everything is written in Java (version 8!). I know that it's not the best choice, but I just wanted to make writing it as simple as possible for me (Java is my primary language for now).

Versioning
----------

It's not really big deal, but I wanted to make it as tidy as possible. For me versioning to this point worked pretty well, but if anybody will join this project it won't make any sense anymore and version number will be added after some significant stage.

(By the way if anybody whose English is better than mine wants to make some language corrections, I see no problem)
